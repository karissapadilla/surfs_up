# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview 
The purpose of the analysis is to identify temperature trends before opening the surf shop specifically for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. 

## Results
After performing the analysis, we determined the following key differences in weather between June and December:
-	The average temperatures were 75 degrees compared to 71 degrees in June and December, respectively.

-	Overall, the temperature for both months are considerable the same.  

## Summary
To summarize, the months of June and December are considerably similar according to the analysis performed with almost similar standard deviation.  In order to further analyze the data that was given to us, additional queries to consider includes:
-	Creating a visual representation of the temperature using plots comparing both months.

-	Creating a visual representation of the precipitation using plots comparing both months.  

Based on the above analysis, there should be no problem from a business planning point of view to open the Surf and Ice Cream shop all-year round.
